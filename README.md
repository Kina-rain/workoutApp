# workoutApp
This project is a workout application to help with your daily/ weekly workout routine.

For this assignment, a workout tracker was created to help with your daily workout routine. Multiple exercises can get logged on a daily basis. 
Using the app you can track the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of exercise. You can even track your distance and if the exercise is cardio or resistance.

The application uses a front end code. While the backend was created using a Mongo database with a Mongoose schema and Express handling the routes.
